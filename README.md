# Calendar Mixer (CalMixer)

> Load two or more calendards and mix them into a single CalDAV source.

Some tools can only process a single calendar and are unusable when the 
appointment landscape is determined by multiple calendar sources. This
tool will dynamically load these calendars and convert them into a single,
up tp date source that can be used for further processing.

## Deployment

### with Docker

Run with Docker:
```bash
docker run --rm -it mrtux/cal-mixer:latest
```

### Development

This project needs [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (at least version 3.2.0) for build and dependency management.

Version numbers are determined with [jgitver](https://jgitver.github.io/). 
Please check your [IDE settings](https://jgitver.github.io/#_ides_usage) to avoid problems, as there are still some unresolved issues.
If you encounter a project version `0` there is an issue with the jgitver generator.

## Build

The build is split into two stages:
1. Packaging with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
2. Building the Docker container

This means that the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) expects one (and only one) JAR file in the target directory.
Build as follows:

```bash
mvn --batch-mode --update-snapshots clean package
docker build .
```

Why not do everything with maven and [JIB](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib)?
So far I have not been able to integrate JIB with the mechanism that determined which tags should be build (e.g. only
build *latest* when on main branch). After 5h of trying I settled with this solution:
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is sufficiently reliable to create reproducible builds, and we can make use of the build cache.
* The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) allows for the usual integration into image build and push.

The whole process is coded in the [docker-publish workflow](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) and only needs to be 
executed manually for local builds.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome!

If possible, please stick to the following guidelines:

* Keep PRs reasonably small and their scope limited to a feature or module within the code.
* If a large change is planned, it is best to open a feature request issue first, then link subsequent PRs to this issue, so that the PRs move the code towards the intended feature.
