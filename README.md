# Calendar Mixer (CalMixer)

> Load two or more calendards and mix them into a single CalDAV source.

Some tools can only process a single calendar and are unusable when the 
appointment landscape is determined by multiple calendar sources. This
tool will dynamically load these calendars and convert them into a single,
up tp date source that can be used for further processing.
