# Calendar Mixer (CalMixer)

> Load two or more calendars and mix them into a single CalDAV source.

Some tools can only process a single calendar and are unusable when the 
appointment landscape is determined by multiple calendar sources. This
tool will dynamically load these calendars and convert them into a single,
up tp date source that can be used for further processing.

## API

Please note: The API is still preliminary and may change heavily!

The following examples use two shell variables:
```bash
SERVICE="service URL"
TOKEN="Session Token"
```

### Creating a session

Until authentication is implemented, sessions identify calendars and are used to assign sources.

A session can be created by a POST call to `/session/create`:
```bash
curl -i -X POST "$SERVICE/session/create"
```

The result will be in the `location` header.

### Session information

The retrieve session information, issue a GET call to the location provided by the create-call: `/session/{token}`:

```bash
curl -i "$SERVICE/session/$TOKEN"
```

### Adding sources

A source configuration consists of:
* `label`: A label for the source. While there are no limitations imposed, simple labels will make life easier downstream.
* `url`: The URL of the calendar source
* `protocol`: The access protocol (`http` or `dav`) - defaults to `http` if not provided
* `token`: A bearer token for DAV authentication
* `user`, `password`: Credentials for HTTP or DAV authentication (note that none or both must be provided)

The parameters `token` or `user`/`password` are optional. In this case no authentication is used.
If all parameters are provided, it is up to the implementation to decide which authentication to use.

Store these parameters in a JSON object and send it as body with a POST to `/session/{token}/source`, for example:
```bash
$CURL -X POST --data '{ "url": "http://localhost:8080/cal/123", "label": "test" }' \
              -H "Content-type: application/json" \
              "${SERVICE}/session/${token}/source"
```

## Deployment

### with Docker

Run with Docker:
```bash
docker run --rm -it mrtux/cal-mixer:latest
```

The container exposes port 8080 for access to the HTTP endpoint.

### Development

This project uses the [Micronaut Framework](https://micronaut.io/).

Version numbers are determined with [jgitver](https://jgitver.github.io/). 
Please check your [IDE settings](https://jgitver.github.io/#_ides_usage) to avoid problems, as there are still some unresolved issues.
If you encounter a project version `0` there is an issue with the jgitver generator.

The application can be run locally with
```bash
./mvnw mn:run
```

## Build

The build is split into two stages:
1. Packaging with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
2. Building the Docker container

This means that the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) expects one (and only one) JAR file in the target directory.
Build as follows:

```bash
mvn --batch-mode --update-snapshots clean package
docker build .
```

Why not do everything with maven and [JIB](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib)?
So far I have not been able to integrate JIB with the mechanism that determined which tags should be build (e.g. only
build *latest* when on main branch). After 5h of trying I settled with this solution:
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is sufficiently reliable to create reproducible builds, and we can make use of the build cache.
* The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) allows for the usual integration into image build and push.

The whole process is coded in the [docker-publish workflow](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) and only needs to be 
executed manually for local builds.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome!

If possible, please stick to the following guidelines:

* Keep PRs reasonably small and their scope limited to a feature or module within the code.
* If a large change is planned, it is best to open a feature request issue first, then link subsequent PRs to this issue, so that the PRs move the code towards the intended feature.
